Welcome readers to my three part series on differential equations. I hope you'll learn something by reading these posts.
As of writing I too am trying to learn.

In this first part, we'll learn about basic differential equations by practicing.

# Section 1: wut differential equations
[Wikipedia has its own definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation), however, my Tl;Dr is as follows:
- Systems are cute
- Some cute systems aren't explicitly described
- Many systems can be defined by how their variables evolve (in terms of other variables in the system)
- Practically speaking, these differential equations can be used to numerically solve for the system.

Let's motivate it with an example: exponential rate of change.

**Setup**

Suppose you have a system of two variables - $P$ for population and $t$ for time (yes, time is a variable imho). Let us also suppose that you have amnesia and forgot the standard exponential growth model, $P = Ke^{ct}$. However, we do know that in a small amount of time, say $dt$, the population changes by $dP = ce^{ct}dt$. This leads us to the following differential equation:
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = ce^{ct}
$$

However, this is an incomplete description if we're trying to utilize this system within some constraints (like most tasks that I can image). If we solve it analytically, we'd see that $P=Ke^{ct}$ where K is unknown. The answer to this incompleteness dilemma is boundary conditions.

**Boundary Conditions**: At first, boundary conditions seem pretty insignificant. However, they are very important and can determine how the system evolves, and sometimes, if it even has a solution. Boundary conditions come in a few varieties. For example, one can either specify the value of variables, or the value of gradients, or a combination of the two. We will not delve further into it.


# Section 2: Reaction and Advection Diffusion Equations
This is a time-evolving differential equation that describes interaction of a few components in space. i.e., we have 4 or more variables: one for time, at least one for space, and at least 2 components. There are three processes at play in this rad equation. *Reaction* describes that the components affect each other; *Advection* indicates that the system is moving; and *Diffusion* indicates that the components are dispersing into the underlying strata.

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dt} = \hat{v} \nabla C_i + D_i \nabla^{2} C_i + f_i(C_0, C_1... C_n)
$$

Here, $C_i$ is the $i^{th}$ component, $v$ is velocity, $\nabla C_i$ is spatial gradient of $C_i$, $\nabla^2$ is the laplacian, and $f_i$ describes the effect of reaction between various components onto $C_i$. This "_reaction_" could be say [catalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis) or [inhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_inhibitor). [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) tells me that there are a few interesting interactions such as:
1. Schnakenberg Model
2. Gray-Scott Model
3. FitzHugh-Nagumo Model

I haven't tried to find references for those three models, but I also have not been able to work with them.

# Section 3: Visuals
```py
# code from https://github.com/HarounH/deqs/blob/main/notebooks/radeqs.ipynb

num_frames = 128
size = 128
num_channels = 3  # RGB

frames = torch.zeros(num_frames, num_channels, size, size, dtype=torch.float32)
_ring_initialization(frames)
frames = simulate(
    frames,
    self_inhibition_social_catalysis,
    D=torch.tensor([0.1, -0.1, 0.2]),
    v=torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5]),
    dt=0.05,
)
animate(frames, "../outputs/debug.gif", overwrite=True)
```

produces the following fun plot where the rings move with a velocity and the constant diffusion, reaction advection seems to cause some form of chaos. I'm sure there's bugs - I don't clip the data to $[0, 1]$ for example.
