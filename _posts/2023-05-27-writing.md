This is a post largely for Haroun's sake. Its a reminder of how to write, both theoretically and practically.

# Part 1: The Motivation
As of writing, there isn't a concrete motivation to write this blog.
That said, _writing_ doesn't have to be about you - in fact, some of the best writing is written for others. It can be written to entertain readers, maybe distract them, maybe educate them - but its for them.
However, simultaneously, _drafting_ is about you and your ideas. Drafting sharpens your thoughts, forces you to distill your knowledge.

# Part 2: How to update and test this blog.
Let's face it, I won't update this blog often. Consequently, I won't remember how to update the blog. This section of this post is a reminder to myself on how to update, test and push changes to the blog.

1. The github project contains a directory for posts - `_posts/`. That is where your files go.
2. Each file is named `yyyy-mm-dd-name.md`.
3. Assets go into the `assets/` directory
4. Once changes are made, test locally using the following command:

```console
haroun7@desktop:~/HarounH.github.io# bundle exec jekyll serve
```
