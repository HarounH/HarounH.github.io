This post contains notes I took while learning [stochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation).

> NOTE: I found [this mathexchange question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3949903/recommendation-for-good-online-videos-for-stochastic-differential-equations) that linked to a few videos, such as this [lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUyjaJA_jjQ&list=PLvpcUbGDkR2Cu_FGZifjh0Lgh1wNs2exH&index=1). Better yet, I also found [this slidedeck](https://web.stanford.edu/~yamins/uploads/2/4/9/2/24920889/presentation.pdf) which was cool to read, and [this lecture](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/dynamic-systems-n-control/idsc-dam/Lectures/Stochastic-Systems/SDE.pdf).

# Arc 1: Theory
Everyone and their grandma describes the one-dimensional ($x$) stochastic
differential equation using a standard weiner process ($W_t$):

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)dt + \sigma(X_t, t)dW_t
$$

To refresh your memory, [a weiner process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process), $W_t$ has a concrete definition, two of which are hella important:
1. $(W_{t+u} - W_t) \perp W_s \ \forall\  s \lt t$
2. $(W_{t+u} - W_t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, u^2)$
The above link also mentions almost surely continuous with $t$ and almost surely 0 at $t=0$.


Equipped with a Weiner process, we can try to "integrate" an SDE.

For a deterministic system, one can define an integral in ways that are equivalent if the function is well behaved (lipschitz continuous, maybe?):

$$
\int_{0}^{T} X(t) dt = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \Sigma_{i=0}^{N} X(t_i) (t_{i+1} - t_{i}) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \Sigma_{i=0}^{N} \frac{X(t_i) + X(t_{i+1})}{2}(t_{i+1} - t_{i})
$$

Unfortunately, the second and third term in the above equation are not equal when $X$ is a stochastic process. Defining the integral in each of the two ways leads to different result. The two are called [Ito Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_calculus) and [Stratonovich Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratonovich_integral). I will not be delving into their differences.

The nuances of stochastic processes affect not just integrals, but also the chain rule. When following Ito's calculus, the chain rule becomes [Ito's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4%27s_lemma). An informal derivation of Ito's Lemma uses the idea that $dW_t^2$ is $\mathcal{O}(dt)$, while other terms in taylor expansion, such as $dtdW_t$ go to zero faster.

The last tidbit is that the probability density function of a stochastic process follows a PDE. The PDE is called the Fokker-Planck Equation, and [a derivation can be found here](https://sites.me.ucsb.edu/~moehlis/moehlis_papers/appendix.pdf). The method for proof involves making a Markov assumption, followed by some neat algebra. The usage of arbitrary functio $h$ was also pretty cool imho.

**Reverse Process**: A lot of SDE stuff looks at how a process evolves forward, and treat $X(t) = \int_{s=-\infty}^{t} f(...)dw(s)$. However, [Anderson 1979](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82826666.pdf) introduce a notion of reverse processes, where $X(t) = -\int_{t}^{\infty} f(...)dw(s)$.

# Arc 2: Practice
Sorry, this section is on hold. I'll come back to it later. For future Haroun, you want to:
1. Do some basic simulations to learn numerical considerations for SDEs.
2. Treat SGD as an SDE, except that instead of a Scalar variable + Weiner process, we have a vector of variables and the gradient of a term wrt to the variables... and I'm not sure what the random variable should be.

This post wouldn't be possible without my dear friend, Shreyas Padhy, who gave me a crash course on SDEs. Also wouldn't be possible without research done by so many people in the past.
